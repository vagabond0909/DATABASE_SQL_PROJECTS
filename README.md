# Social Media Database Design Using MySQL

## INTRODUCTION

This project is about building instagram database clone! And that's actually an exaggeration we're only cloning the database. And even then we're only doing like 7 or 8 
tables not you know 20 or 50 Instagram tables but still we're doing the basics the important stuff photos and comments and users and likes and follow you know follower
following relationships hashtags all that fun stuff all the relationships between them and then all those joints.


We're going to focus on a bit of a case study. We're going to work with a site that you're probably familiar with Instagram and we're going to try and clone the database for 
some of the basic functionality so we're not going to be diving into like advertising and keeping track of our users data and all that. We're really focusing on the main big
entities to a site like Instagram things like photos and comments and users and so on. So again we're not really scratching the surface as to how Instagram actually stores
everything. So we will talk a little bit about performance but this is really more about how do you design a schema for something that has in our example at least seven or eight
tables in Instagram. The real app there's probably dozens of tables but either way it's a big step up from two tables or three tables Max. For this, We are going to design schemas
for that 7 to 8 tables and then inserting a huge clone data(made for this project) which is provided in the dataset.txt file and finally will run different queries on that
database which are more real world and not traditional direct mentioned.
